# X2-SYNC-001

## Goal
Implement conflict-resolution policy skeleton for synced tasks/memories.

## Scope
- Add deterministic policy helpers for task/memory conflict resolution.
- Encode precedence rules (last_confirmed_at, confidence, updated_at, source ownership).
- Unit test conflict choices.

## Acceptance
- Conflict resolution helper functions exist with tests
- Rules are documented in code/comments
