# S1-SEC-001

## Goal
Improve policy denials to be explainable and structured.

## Scope
- Update security policy path(s) so deny results include a reason/code and matched rule context.
- Add/prepare a hook for emitting policy-deny events into observability timeline (no full event integration required).
- Maintain backward compatibility where callers expect plain messages.

## Acceptance
- Deny path returns enough structured context for UI/logging
- Existing behavior is preserved or clearly adapted with tests
