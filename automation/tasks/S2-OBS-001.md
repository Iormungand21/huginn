# S2-OBS-001

## Goal
Add replay-mode and budget metric skeletons.

## Scope
- Add replay session/event reader skeleton using event timeline files.
- Add summary helpers for cost/latency budgets in diagnostics/status path.
- Keep execution replay stubbed if full implementation is too large.

## Acceptance
- Replay-related types/functions added with clear TODO boundaries
- Status/doctor can report basic budget summary if data exists
