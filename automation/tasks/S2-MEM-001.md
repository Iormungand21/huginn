# S2-MEM-001

## Goal
Lay groundwork for episodic vs semantic memory and confidence decay.

## Scope
- Extend memory types/config with episodic/semantic distinction and decay metadata logic helpers.
- Add helper functions for confidence decay calculation and recency scoring.
- Avoid full database migration in this task unless very small.

## Acceptance
- Memory utility functions added with tests for decay behavior
- Clear integration TODOs documented in memory modules
