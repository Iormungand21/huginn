# S1-OBS-001

## Goal
Add structured event timeline primitives and a simple file sink.

## Scope
- Add `src/events.zig` event schema types.
- Add `src/events_store.zig` with a minimal JSONL append sink (or skeleton API + TODO if serialization is too large for one task).
- Keep integration minimal; no widespread event emission yet.

## Acceptance
- Event types defined with IDs/timestamps/session/task correlation fields
- File sink API exists and is documented
