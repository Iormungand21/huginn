# S2-SEC-001

## Goal
Add secret scoping and per-workspace approval policy config primitives.

## Scope
- Extend config types and parsing for secret scope and workspace-specific approval rules.
- Add policy lookup helper skeletons.
- No full enforcement rollout required yet.

## Acceptance
- Config schema additions parse safely (backward compatible)
- Helpers documented for later enforcement
