# S1-MEM-001

## Goal
Add a typed memory record schema and metadata primitives without breaking existing memory backends.

## Scope
- Add `src/memory/types.zig` with enums/structs for memory kinds, tiers, source metadata, and typed record.
- Export/re-export types from `src/memory/root.zig` (or another central memory module) so later tasks can import them.
- Keep this task schema-only; no SQLite migration yet.

## Acceptance
- Code compiles (or is syntactically valid if Zig unavailable)
- New types are documented with concise comments
- No existing memory behavior changes
