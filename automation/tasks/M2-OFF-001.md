# M2-OFF-001

## Goal
Add offline queue and deferred sync-out skeleton for `muninn`.

## Scope

- Add local enqueue/dequeue persistence skeleton (JSON file or SQLite stub).
- No full network transport implementation yet.

## Acceptance
- Queue types + persistence skeleton exist
- Clear future integration points documented
