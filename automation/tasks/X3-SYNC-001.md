# X3-SYNC-001

## Goal
Define federated task routing handshake and heartbeat message flow.

## Scope
- Add types and state transitions for handshake/heartbeat between nodes.
- Include degraded-mode/offline markers in protocol state.
- No full transport wiring yet.

## Acceptance
- Handshake and heartbeat types/state enums exist and are documented
- Clear integration path for future transport implementation
